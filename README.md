# MAppGraph
This repository contains the code of the paper MAppGraph: Mobile-App Classification on Encrypted Network
Traffic using Deep Graph Convolution Neural Networks.
Please [cite](#References) MAppGraph when using it in academic publications.

## Introduction
MAppGraph introduces a method for processing network traffic and generating graphs with node features and edge weights that better represent the communication behavior of mobile apps. A Deep Graph Convolution Neural Network (DGCNN) model has been designed and developed to learn the communication behavior of mobile apps from a large number of graphs, thus being able to classify mobile apps.

## Documentation
We provide an extensive documentation including instructions for running the code at [MAppGraph](https://soeai.github.io/MAppGraph/).
