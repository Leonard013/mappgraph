# MAppGraph
This repository contains the code of the paper MAppGraph: Mobile-App Classification on Encrypted Network
Traffic using Deep Graph Convolution Neural Networks.
Please [cite](#References) MAppGraph when using it in academic publications.

## Introduction
MAppGraph introduces a method for processing network traffic and generating graphs with node features and edge weights that better represent the communication behavior of mobile apps. After that, DGCNN model is used to learn the communication behavior of mobile apps from a large number of graphs. This model achieves very high performance in mobile-app classification.
